To do -
(not sure on final logic to compare and display the assigned ships from the launch)
METHOD:
. Compare the 5 ship id's from the latest launch state with each id from the ship state
. Compare each using filter and display the data (name, type and home port) from the ships state if the ids match
. I would also have applied a gif spinner for fetching the data
